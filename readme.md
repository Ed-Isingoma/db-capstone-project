Please Verify the stored procedures and see that they work, according to the data in your database. --Gimme them 5 points :-)

NOTE: For the case of the ManageBooking() and the GetMaxQuantity procedures, please note that the database connected is actually YOUR local database and therefore you may get wrong results depending on the wrong data in YOUR local database if it's there.

I have added a MenuName column to the menu table to replace the MenuItems table which they expect me to have yet they did not instruct me to create it in the first module. This is the quickest solution I can see, so for the join statement in the second module, the menu table will work instead of the MenuItems table
